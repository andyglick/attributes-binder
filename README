
Attribute binder and metadata extractor.

This is similar to injection-based micro component containers but with some 
additional features (support for pulling as well as injecting attributes, 
separation of lifecycle phases, statically extracted metadata and builder
classes).

Mainly for use with Carrot2 clustering components (document sources, algorithms) but
can be used as a stand-alone binder to inject and extract attribute values
from components.
